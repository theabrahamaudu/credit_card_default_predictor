    "# Analysis of Low Default Portfolio in Austrialian Credit Data.\n",
    "This Notebook aims to tackle the `low default Portfolio problem in Credit scoring datasets`. Credit scoring in the means of computationally ascribing a number to a customer that depicts their creditworthiness (the confidence that the will repay a line of credit). Good customers get higher numbers while customers who default have lower mumbers, these numbers usually vary between 350 - 800. A good credit score can open various oppurtunities to loans, mortgages, and social oppurtunities, the reverse is the case for bad credit scores, as people with bad credit scores are subject to very high interest rates and limited social oppurtunities. It then becomes important to have a very good method for calculating credit scores, a method such as data science.\n",
    "Using data science as a tool for determining credit scores encounters a common problem called class imbalance, in the credit scoring domain it is referred to as the low default portfolio problem. It's a phenomenon where in a data set the number of defaulters are miniscule when compared to the number of non-defaulters, therefore skewing the distribution of the dataset overwhemling in one direction. This poses a problem for data science tools because it makes interpreting results much more difficult as the data is already skewed to one side, and any algorithm used to fit such that will have a bias towards the non-defaulters.\n"

It can be seen that A8 correlates with A15 than any others and A9 and A10 correlate with each other, which means we will take one of them out.

    "# Analysis\n",
    "For the ideal run with feature selection, all the algorithms performed well, In terms of testing times, the MLP spent the longest whilst the Naive Bayes spent the least time. `Accuracy` is pertinent in this run, as both classes are evenly represented, the best three algorithms in this regard were `Logistic Regression`, `Naive Bayes` and `ANN`. Same with the `MCC` metric with `SVM` coming in third as opposed to ANN. The story is different for the `AUCROC` and `AUCPRC` metric were the best performing algorithms were `Logistic Regression`, `Proposed Ensemble` and `ANN`. Although difference in performance was minimal, it can be inferred that the best algorithm in this run was `Logistic Regression` accross all metrics.\n"

    "# Imbalanced Run\n",
    "In the real world Credit datasets are highly imbalanced and skewed with an over representation of non-defaulters, as such it is paramount that a model should at the very least retain discriminitive abilities as data becomes more and more skewed. The rest of the experiments have to do with assessing the performance of the afformentioned algorithms when the data is imbalanced 60/40, 70/30, 80/30, 90/10. To see which deals with imbalances the best. It is proposed that the developed ensemble will perform best over the imbalances. Realised that python packages do not allow for artificial imbalance. To fix soon."

Originally it appears as a dataset with strings and intergers, but there is a numeric version alos abialble at the repository. Some preprocessing has been done in advance as all the column names have been anonymized and all have numerical values. There are 70% of non-defaulters and 30% of defaulters in the class or target attribute. Further exploratory analysis of the data set is done below. The dataset also  contains a cost amtrix for cost sensitive classification if needed."

    "In the ideal run for the german dataset, the dataset contained 630 values for defaulters and non defaulters. The results displayed in the table about are excellent but also counter intuitive. Most of the algorithms achieved an accuracy of 100% but vary in performance in Area under the Precision Recall Curve, where the max is 1 and minimum is zero. This suggests that something or some other arrangement within the data was learnt by the algorithms and this affected their performance. This will be further investigated in subsequent distributions of the dataset."

    "The next step is to create visualizations from the data collected from the results and show the performances of the different algorithms across both datasets and show which algorithm(s) performed best and try to determine why. For the above dataframe, it can be noticed that the aussie part of the data which is X suffixed looks as we would expect, but the german part of the data has inconsistent results in terms of performance of the algorithms. This suggests that there may be something wrong with the dataset set such that the algorithms are learning the wrong function. Visualization might confirm this suspicion or the dataset can be switched to the other german dataset."
