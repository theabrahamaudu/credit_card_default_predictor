# Credit Card Default Predictor

This app is able to take user credit card data and make a prediction on whether the user will default
on their next credit card payment or not. 
It can be used by interacting with the web UI.

## Description

The prediction infrastructure of this project was built using a [credit card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) from kaggle.
The dataset was then preprocessed to deal with categorical variables, under-sampled to deal with data imbalance, as well as scaling, to bring all the features within a narrow range for better performance.
Four models were trained on the dataset:
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine

All the models as well as the ecoder and scaler were saved to memory so as to enable the transformation of new data from end users before prediction on the data.

The app has a prediction API built with FastAPI and a frontend built with Streamlit

## Basic Workflow
  - Perform EDA
  - Preprocess raw data and save encoder and scaler
  - Train models and save models
  - Test models
  - Setup API service
  - Design frontend

## API Structure
The API service has two endpoints:
* Home: Used to test that the API is running

* Predict: API service has a prediction endpoint which:
  - Takes in data from the web UI
  - Load prediction model selected by user
  - Convert user credit card JSON data to DataFrame
  - Make prediction based on credit card data
  - Return predicted outcome as float

## Frontend Structure
The frontend is built with Streamlit.  
How it works:
  - Promts the user to upload customer credit card data as .csv file
  - Validates data and displays error message if uploaded data does not match model requirements
  - Allows the user to select a preferred prediction model only if the right file type has been uploaded
  - Makes a post request to the prediction endpoint with data provided by user
  - Displays a formatted version of the request response
